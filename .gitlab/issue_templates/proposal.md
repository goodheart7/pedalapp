## User Story
As a Thrifa customer, I want a chat option, so that customer service can be easier.

## Problem
Given a customer wants to communicate with us, what option should he use?

## Current Solution
We ask the customer what kind of communication works best for him and use that.

## Proposed Solution
We ask the customer to use our integrated chat https://www.zoho.com/salesiq/.

## Why is the proposed solution better
- it integrates nicely on our web site and web app, improving our image
- it helps us moving towards 24x7 customer service
- salesiq can collect customer data like location

## Expected outcome
- sales: increase by 10% because we look more professional now
- service: time consumption decreases by 5%, response time is now measurable
- we know the location of customers

## Expected Cost
10 hours

## Specs
- `thrifa-business` should provide chat support on https://www.zoho.com/salesiq/
